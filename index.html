				The demonization of nuclear power
			</h3>
			<p class="content-block">
				In Italy, the story of nuclear energy is not
				just a narrative of technology and policy but a saga woven deeply into the emotional
				fabric of the nation. <span class="highlight">The Italian resistance to nuclear power
					is profound</span>, reflecting a collective sentiment shaped by countless propagands against
				this energy source, carried out for political interests.
			</p>

			<p class="content-block">
				The resistance is fueled by vivid memories of global nuclear disasters like the <span
					class="highlight">1986
					Chernobyl
					accident</span>, which imprinted a sense of danger associated with nuclear technology in the
				national
				consciousness. The Italian landscape, with its stunning natural beauty, is something locals cherish
				deeply. The idea of nuclear accidents poses a threat not just to the environment but to the very
				soul of the country. For Italians, the risks of nuclear energy, including long-lasting nuclear
				waste and the potential for catastrophic accidents, seem too great a gamble.

				However, it's important to recognize that nuclear power also offers numerous advantages,
				and its production is not inherently wrong, as we are going to demonstrate throughout this
				report. Indeed, nuclear energy is a highly efficient source of electricity that can help reduce
				dependency on fossil fuels, thus significantly cutting greenhouse gas emissions. This is
				particularly crucial as the world seeks sustainable solutions to combat climate change.

				Additionally, <span class="highlight">nuclear power provides a stable and reliable source of
					energy</span>.
				Unlike renewable sources such as solar and wind, which depend on weather conditions and
				time of day, nuclear energy can produce electricity continuously, 24/7. This consistency
				is invaluable for maintaining the energy supply needed to support Italy's industrial base
				and residential needs without interruption. Additionally, the technology behind nuclear energy
				has also advanced significantly. Modern nuclear reactors are designed with enhanced safety
				features that reduce the risk of accidents.

						The aim is to highlight the need for a low environmental impact energy source such as
						nuclear through the use of simple and effective visualizations. It provides a clear view of
						what is the actual consumption and production of energy and what are the various indicators
						that show the environmental impact for the different energy sources widely used.
