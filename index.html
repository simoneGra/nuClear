          The demonization of nuclear power
        </h3>
        <p class="content-block">
          In Italy, the story of nuclear energy is not
          just a narrative of technology and policy but a saga woven deeply into the emotional
          fabric of the nation. <span class="highlight">The Italian resistance to nuclear power 
          is profound</span>, reflecting a collective sentiment shaped by countless propagands against 
          this energy source, carried out for political interests.
        </p>

        <p class="content-block">
          The resistance is fueled by vivid memories of global nuclear disasters like the 1986 Chernobyl 
          accident, which imprinted a sense of danger associated with nuclear technology in the national 
          consciousness. The Italian landscape, with its stunning natural beauty, is something locals cherish 
          deeply. The idea of nuclear accidents poses a threat not just to the environment but to the very 
          soul of the country. For Italians, the risks of nuclear energy, including long-lasting nuclear
          waste and the potential for catastrophic accidents, seem too great a gamble.

          However, it's important to recognize that nuclear power also offers numerous advantages, 
          and its production is not inherently wrong, as we are going to demonstrate throughout this 
          report. Indeed, nuclear energy is a highly efficient source of electricity that can help reduce 
          dependency on fossil fuels, thus significantly cutting greenhouse gas emissions. This is 
          particularly crucial as the world seeks sustainable solutions to combat climate change.
        </p>

      <div class="blocco">
        
        <p class="content-block">
          Additionally, nuclear power provides a stable and reliable source of energy. 
          Unlike renewable sources such as solar and wind, which depend on weather conditions and 
          time of day, nuclear energy can produce electricity continuously, 24/7. This consistency 
          is invaluable for maintaining the energy supply needed to support Italy's industrial base 
          and residential needs without interruption. Additionally, the technology behind nuclear energy 
          has also advanced significantly. Modern nuclear reactors are designed with enhanced safety 
          features that reduce the risk of accidents.
