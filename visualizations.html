								This set of graphs depicts the energy consumption levels across Italian regions spanning

								measured in GWh, and the sector-specific consumption within that region. Conversely, the

								data for all regions and sectors, enabling effortless and clear comparison of the energy
								consumption trends over the past 22 years.

							Evolution of Energy Production by Source

						<div class="success-prompt-prompt">
							<p>
								This animated bar chart illustrates the evolution of energy levels, measured in GWh,
								produced by various sources in Italy from 1883 to 2022. Through the animation, viewers
								can observe the progression of different energy sources over time and identify the years
								when they were introduced. Solar energy emerges as the most recent addition, while
								hydroelectric power stands out as the oldest and consistently highest producer
								throughout history. Interestingly, during the 1970s, hydroelectric power was overtaken
								by thermoelectric power, despite its longstanding dominance.

						<div class="success-prompt-prompt">
							<p>
								These two graphs illustrate the historical trends in energy production in Italy,
								spanning from 1883 to 2022. The energy levels, measured in GWh, are presented for five
								distinct sources: geothermal, solar, nuclear, hydroelectric, and thermoelectric. Users
								can utilize a slider to select a desired range of years, enabling them to observe not
								only the disparities between the energy levels required and those produced by Italian
								regions, but also the years when each source was introduced. Additionally, users can
								examine the production levels for each energy source individually, providing a
								comprehensive overview of energy production across different sectors.

							Environmental Impact Scores

						<div class="success-prompt-prompt">
							<p>
								The Radar Chart analyzes the degree of influence of each source on the environment and sustainability 
								through a series of indicators represented at the top of the chart.
								The values within the graph are scaled accordingly to allow a direct comparison between the different energy sources. 
								In this context, the value 0 represents a zero environmental impact, while the value 1 corresponds to the maximum impact recorded. 
								This standardised scale facilitates the relative assessment of energy sources, enabling a rapid understanding of which 
								source can have the most significant environmental impact.
								The table associated with the graph provides further details, including the actual values of the measurements and their units of measurement.
								Analyzing the data, some trends clearly emerge. For example, hard Coal is one of the most harmful energy sources for the environment and man, 
								showing high levels of "unsustainability" in almost all indicators considered. On the contrary, nuclear energy emerges as one 
								of the least impacting energy sources, except for a high water consumption necessary for the cooling system of uranium rods.
